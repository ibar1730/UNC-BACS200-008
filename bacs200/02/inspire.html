            What makes him a hero? Michael inspired many with his story coming up to the NFL. Coming up from the worse conditions, in the hood, people dying everyday, etc. Many upcoming athetles looked at him as an inspiration.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Motivate others - Athletes after watching the movie "The Blind Side" were most certaintly motivated and humbled after watching such a struggle</li>
            <li>Leader - Oher gave others that were in the same slump a shot in their minds</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <p>
            He gave kids a right mind set and hope. Athletes that come from bad households can see his story realte to it and give themselves an oppurtunity.
